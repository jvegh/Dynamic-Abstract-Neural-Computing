\chapter*{Quick Start\label{ch:QuickStart}}

As the Human Brain Project formulated, to enter a new level,
"a \hypertarget{NewUnderstanding}{new understanding} of the brain" is needed. It is also correct that "integration between data and knowledge from different disciplines, and catalysing a community effort" is requested. It really needs several disciplines, openness, and deep knowledge of the related disciplines from the researchers, furthermore also \textit{some knowledge about the bridges to the other disciplines}, as Feynman expressed. Furthermore, \textit{finding the extraordinary laws of physics},
including \textit{developing the needed mathematical handling}, as Schrödinger expected. Moreover, after that, \textit{a community effort along the principles of the new theoretical understanding} for validating it is needed and revisiting the interpretation of the results of former observations in light of the "new understanding".
The present content was written in the spirit of Feynman that we  
 must ”have no respect whatsoever for authority; forget who said it and instead look what he starts with, where he ends up, and ask yourself, ’Is it reasonable?’". Reading it needs the same attitude.
It needs much patience; the more patience and effort, the more the reader knows about the subject in the "old understanding". The "new understanding", the "extraordinary laws" of physics, spiced with newly developed mathematics,
is not easy, not quick, and not effortless; furthermore, it requires a well-controlled thinking, much above the level "this way we used to interpret the things and reply to this question for decades". Our discussion is a much more faithful description of neurons' operation than the old one.


The miserable fact is that several aspects of the "old understanding" are wrong. Among others
\begin{itemize}
 \item physiology has a statical view.
 Experimentally, \hyperlink{voltage-clamping}{clamping and patching (using feedback)}
 introduce foreign currents into the cell, stop its native operation
 and enable deriving conclusions from that artificial, statical operating mode for the native,
 dynamical operating mode.
 Theoretically, statical \textit{states} are assumed,
 and the experienced dynamicity (\textit{processes}) is accounted for as perturbation.
 Instead of currents, the \textit{voltage gradient}, instead of currents,
 controls the neuronal oscillator's operation, which is known from the well-established theory of electricity
 but neglected in physiology.
\index{voltage gradient}
 \item the static view does not need (furthermore, does not enable to find) the laws of motion (in the sense of laws of Newton, Schrödinger, Hamilton)
 \item laws of classical physics developed for infinite, homogeneous, structureless medium, where the interactions have the same speed, are applied
 to finite, inhomogeneous, structured living matter, where \textit{the interactions have enormously different speeds}
 \item neglected that neurons' potential changes are the results of electrochemical (electrodiffusional) instead of net electrical processes
 \item the biological matter's conduction mechanism differs from the one in metals (leading to assuming the conduction speed of free electrons in ionic solutions for ions; a wrong interpretation of conductance; wrong discussion of the electric operation of cells based on false analogies with classic electric circuits)
 \item the Coulomb repulsion between ions is neglected that, excludes  understanding that
 \begin{itemize} 
 \item ionic currents are present on the surface of the membrane and in the axons 
 \item how signals propagate in the absence of external electrical voltage 
 \item slow currents and finite sizes are responsible for the timing relations of the cells
 \end{itemize}
 \item introduced false electrical equivalent circuits that excludes understanding that 
 \begin{itemize}
 \item the voltage is location- and time-dependent during AP creation 
 \item the communication network has a heavily time-dependent operation 
 \item the neuronal signal processing and computation works with temporal arguments and results
 \end{itemize}
 \item in the neuronal oscillator, a wrong oscillator type is in use; the 
 vital component
 %\gls{AIS}
 AIS, discovered and understood two decades ago,
  is not yet integrated into neuronal operation (leading to the ad-hoc introduction of a non-existent rectifying current)
 \end{itemize}
  Consequently, what followed was wrong, including the computational principles, just because of the wrong model. 

You may have arrived with different backgrounds and interests. Consequently, you may have different spots of interest and paths through this material.
The site is about neuron-based computing, which, for today, may mean
very different topics. The primary goal is to deal with biologically
implemented neurons' operation (they are created 'as is'; maybe not entirely understood,
but attempting to discover it) and also artificially manufactured neurons
which attempt to imitate the biological ones, grasping one or more
of their proper features; furthermore, their networks, operations, features
and fallacies. A further goal is to understand the features of their
larger assemblies, and how they implement advanced computations.

Physiology, with its static view, relies on biophysics, which applies
the existing ('ordinary') laws of classic physics in an inadequate way,
and the classic physics derived its laws for 'another construction'; 
that is, biological matter also needs different mathematical 
formalism. All this is derived here in a disciplinary way,
needing \hyperlink{zigzagdiscussion}{zigzag reading}. 
\index{von Neumann!'zigzag' way}
As emphasized many times, we confine our discussion to some abstract 
disciplinary level, with pointers to special topics.
We interpret known physiological evidence on top of the correct 'extraordinary' laws of physics and derive the needed mathematical handling
separately but in parallel with that physics.
The physiological conclusions should be understood even if you do not
understand the underlying physics and mathematics details.
If you understand \textit{why} the non-ordinary physical laws for 
living matter are more or less different from the ordinary ones
for non-living matter, you may leave the details for your expert colleagues.
Mathematical handling also involves the fundamental principles
of using the %\hyperlink{Abstractions}
{abstractions and approximations} of constructing
laws for physics and needs a thorough knowledge of both fields.
Anyhow, you will need to know that college-level physics
is usually not sufficient to understand the deepness of the material
and you will need to re-read the notions; the more you know it (and especially
the more false biophysics you learned) the more carefully. A half-understanding
of the physical base hinders your learning and development of brain science.


Nature is overly complex: science fields must use
different \hyperlink{Abstractions}{approximations and abstractions}.
When setting up a holistic model, we attempt to \textit{see the forest for the trees}.
We must pass
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charybdis}{between 'Scylla' and 'Charybdis'}:
being still
sufficiently accurate and detailed in describing phenomena while keeping the mathematical complexity
(and computational need) of description still manageable.
Without recognizing that, really, "no single researcher or discovery 
[and we add: even no 'vibrant ecosystem for rigorous and ethical research with human research participants as partners' or 'a community effort']
will solve the brain’s mysteries"~\cite{BrainInitiative10:2024} without understanding that living matter needs different approaches and testing methods from science.
We must express the same fundamental principles in the form of different laws. To do so, we must revisit whether we did the appropriate simplifications and approximations, furthermore, if we mapped those correct phenomena to the appropriate mathematical descriptions. We must defy some important misconceptions, provide the right conceptions,
and explain why the wong concept misguides research.


We proceed in a \hyperlink{zigzagdiscussion}{zigzag way}
when discussing different levels of understanding.
Our discussion is closely related to %\hyperlink{Physics}
{physics}, discussed in chapter~\ref{ch:Physics}.
When discussing the underlying physical laws,
we assume a knowledge of classic physics above college-level 
and go back to the very basic physical notions and principles instead of taking over the
\hyperlink{Abstractions}
{approximations and abstractions} (in this context: ordinary laws of physics)
used in the \textit{classic physics for non-biological matter} and
less complex (strictly pair-wise, single type, finite  interaction speed in
\index{interaction!attributes}
homogenous isotropic medium) interactions.
We provide a holistic picture,
from a physical point of view, by explaining  which physical/physiological components cooperate.
We derive \hyperlink{PhysicsLawsOfMotion}
{the laws of motion} for thermodynamical/physiological processes of biology in section~\ref{sec:Physics-LawsOfMotion} (in this context, 'non-ordinary laws of physics'), 
and introduce a \hyperlink{atomic_layer}
{component which implements them}.
In chapter~\ref{ch:Physiology} we go to a \hyperlink{AbstractPhysiology}
{less abstract level} ("abstract physiology").
We summarize
how the components are put together to form, conceptually, 
the dynamic operation of neural systems, including that \textit{why}
{the action potential} is evoked; futhermore, in general, \textit{how} the processes happen.
This abstract discussion serves as a basis for explaining what %\hyperlink{BiologicalComputing}
{computing for biology}
means, see chapter~\ref{ch:Computing}; how the idea of computing can be generalized
to include the biological implementation, furthermore, how biology implements
those general computing principles. Similarly, we use these abstact notions
when we go one step closer to the mystery how information is
represented, encoded and decoded, transmitted and processed,
in chapter~\ref{ch:Information}. After reviewing the operation of individual neurons, we study their cooperation of their "constellations" in chapter~\ref{ch:Multiple}. We show how
those elementary operations confine the functionality of vast populations of neurons, belonging to the notion of intelligence in chapter~\ref{ch:Intelligence}. 


Although the brain's activity is traditionally called computing, 
we show that it can be considered computing only in general:
the principles and concepts are the same, but the implementation
are entirely different.
Similarly, we must reinterpret the notion of information and its processing for the brain.
These chapters build on top of the former ones, although only slightly connected to them.

We separate the operation of single neurons from the cooperation of neurons, a vital point for understanding the brain's elementary operation.
We also provide hints how those operations affect intelligence.

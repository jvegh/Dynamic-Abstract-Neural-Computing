		\caption{Timing relations of von Neumann's complete timing model, with data transfer time in chained operations; synchronization becomes an issue as the physical size of the computing system grows. Notice that synchrony signals must be bypassed or neglected.
		Timing relations of von Neumann's timing model: the data \textit{transfer} time neglected apart from data \textit{processing} time; synchronization can have small dispersion. Notice that the central synchronization signal appears at different places in the processor at different times. \label{fig:Computing_Timing}}

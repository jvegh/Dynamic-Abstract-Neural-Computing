# Dynamic abstract neural computing

The project establishes the physical basis of neuronal computing
(and in general, neuronal operation) which establishes
the operation of the brain.


## Description/theory

This is the detailed operation of neurons. It describes the operation
without physiological and biochemical details, using the correct physics.
It provides a new, unified (cross-disciplinary), model of operation,
which explains the experienced mechanical, thermodynamic and electrical
observations without contradiction.
It shows why the correct electrical description provides a satisfactory
description of the action potential from the first principles
(i.e., without using empirical functions and ad hoc assumptions)
and explains the observed features of its transmission using
the soliton model and the cross-disciplinary theory.
Among other, it derives the correct origin of the resting potential
and the dynamic operation of the neuron.
The theory fixes the mistakes in the classical Hodgkin-Huxley theory
and explains that the discrete nature of neural electricity (the slow current)
drastically changes the picture how neurons compute.
For those discussion, one has to reinterpret physical laws for living matter.


## Neuronal simulator

A simulator is attached as an independent object.
The simulator is based on a SystemC engine, so it can
simulate the time-dependent processes of living matter.

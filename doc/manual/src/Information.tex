"In the terminology of communication theory and information
theory, [a neuron] is a \hypertarget{NeuronInformationBroadcast}{multiaccess, partially degraded broadcast channel}
that performs computations on data received at thousands of
input terminals and transmits information to thousands of output
terminals by means of a time-continuous version of pulse position.
Moreover, [a neuron] engages in an extreme form of
network coding; \textit{it does not store or forward the information it
receives but rather fastidiously computes a certain functional of
the union of all its input spike trains} which it then conveys to a
multiplicity of select recipients"~\cite{EnergyEfficientNeuralComputing:2010}.

The theoretical model~\cite{VeghNeuralShannon:2022} described how
the slow operation of biological objects explains biological phenomena,
but  due to the lack of dedicated measurements
it could only indirectly underpin the theory's correctness. Now, we
give an exact quantitative explanation of the precise measurements~\cite{HodgkinHuxley:1952,SynapticTransmissionMason:1991},
which have not been correctly understood in the past decades due to
the lack of understanding of the role of the finite interaction speed
(conduction velocity) in neuronal operations.

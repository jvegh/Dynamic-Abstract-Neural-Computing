% The foreword for information

Applying \hypertarget{InformationForBiology}{Shannon's information theory}~\cite{ShannonOriginal:1948} to neuroscience
started immediately after the significance of Shannon's seminal paper was recognized, and different research directions began to use it (for a review, see~\cite{InformationNeuroscienceDimitrov:2011}).
Although Shannon warned~\cite{ShannonBandwagon:1956} against the indiscriminate use of the theory and called attention to its valid scope:
"The hard core of information theory is, essentially, a branch of mathematics", and it "is not a trivial matter of translating words to a new domain". The improper application of
the information theory to neural communication is going on~\cite{InformationTheoryIntersection:2008,InformationTheoryAbused:2019}.

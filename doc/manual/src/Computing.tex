	The false parallels with electric circuits (i.e., neglecting the fundamental differences between the \textit{digital} and \textit{neuro-logical} operating modes),
moreover the preconception that nature-made \hypertarget{BiologicalComputing}{biological computing} must follow notions and conceptions of manufactured computing systems hinders understanding genuine biological computing.

As discussed in \cite{ThreeStateUnidirectional:2004,
MarkovianIonChannel:2005}, for the adequate description of the operation
of ion channels, the major components of neuronal computing, three-state systems must be used.
In the present two-state digital electronic logic systems, discharging the internal capacitances can be considered a "refractory" period, i.e., a third state, which defines time's direction. However, it is not known if such a third state can be available among the quantum states at all.
Because of these reasons,  in the foreseeable future, quantum computers will not
represent an alternative general-purpose architecture.
 "Building such machines are decades away" \cite{ScienceQuantumComputers:2018}.

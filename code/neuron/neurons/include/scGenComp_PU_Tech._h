/*
 * \class scGenComp_PU_Tech
 * \brief  A simple abstract class to implement the operation of a general Tech computing unit
 *
 * Operating principle of event processing:
 *
 * The non-virtual "XXX_method"s are "sensitive" to specific events. After receiving such an an event,
 * the corresponding virtual routine of "XXX_Do" is called.
 * If the unit's state and the call are not compatible (programming mistake), that routine asserts.
 * (wrong event)
 * The time delay of the operation is simulated by issuing a wait() call to SystemC kernel.
 * Optionally, also the next state is invoked by issuing a EVENT_GenComp.XXX.notify() notification.
 * The description is valid for methods
 * - Deliver
 * - Process
 * - Relax
 * - Synchronize
 *
 * @see AbstractGenCompState
 *
 * The rest of methods are of technical nature.
 * - HeartBeat: technical signal to update PU's state (e.g. integrate a signal)
 * - Fail: something went wrong, retry
 * - Sleep: if the unit is unused, sends it logically to sleep
 * - Wakeup: awake it if it was sleeping
 *
 * Operating mode:
 * - in synchronized mode, an external clock signal advances states
 * from "Relaxing' to 'Computing', and 'Computing' to 'Delivering', then autonomously to 'Relaxing'
 * - in asynchron mode, an internal, per module, 'Heartbeat' signal is used to advance from state to state
 * - in asynchron mode , the operations can be of fixed time
 * (such as fetch time or execution time in technical systems) or variable time (such as periodic checking
 * of variable length of states depending on analog quantities in biological systems)
 * when heartbeat serves for periodic checking of states),
 * here heartbeat routines provide state change transition signals
 *
 * 'Computing' and 'Delivering' can be done in parallel ('Relative refractory' in biology,
 * pre-fetching in technology)
